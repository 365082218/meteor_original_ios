### IGOR'S FEEDBACK
- EVENT: AnimClip event Ease <- PROBLEMS IN PLAY MODE, use sample instead of play

#### TODO
- UX: hard to rightclick trigger events
- UX: UNDO!

- EVENT: Continous particle mode

- ANIMATION DATA: Shake/Noise/Random - Secondary animation issues

- PROPERTY: particle element stuff
- PARAMETER/FIELD: Enums and bitmasks are currently not supported

- (LOW PRIO) FIELD TYPE: Random by curve distribution 
- (LOW PRIO) UX: Locking event to other events positionwise (hard to visualize) 
- (LOW PRIO) UX: resize track height
